# Project Statement – Student Course Registration System

## 1. Problem Statement
In many educational institutions, students manually register for courses by filling out forms or contacting administrators. This process is slow, error-prone, and lacks transparency. Students often struggle to keep track of available courses and their own registrations.  
To address these challenges, this project proposes a Java-based Course Registration System that automates the entire workflow and provides a simple, reliable solution for course management.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The system allows students to:
- View available courses
- Login/register as a student
- Enroll in courses
- Drop enrolled courses
- View their registered course list

Administrators (or the system itself) can:
- Add new courses
- View all courses

The project uses Java and basic file handling/collections to maintain student and course records.

## 3. Target Users
- **Students** who need a digital method of course registration  
- **Academic administrators** who want to maintain course data  
- **Educational institutions** looking for a lightweight course management solution  

## 4. High-Level Features
- Student Registration & Login  
- Course Listing & Search  
- Course Enrollment & Removal  
- Viewing Student-Specific Course Records  
- Simple menu-driven interface  
- Modular and maintainable Java code following OOP principles
